## 📝 Traditional NLP Methods


**Traditional NLP** refers to approaches that rely on linguistic rules, statistical models, or simpler vector representations rather than deep learning.  

### Key Methods
1. **Rule-Based Methods**  
   - Definition: Uses handcrafted rules for tasks like grammar checking or simple chatbots.  
   - Applications: Spell checkers, grammar correction, basic chatbots  
   

2. **Statistical Methods**  
   - Definition: Uses probability models to predict or classify text.  
   - Applications: POS tagging, Named Entity Recognition, Speech Recognition  

3. **Bag-of-Words / TF-IDF**  
   - Definition: Converts text to numerical vectors for analysis.  
   - Applications: Document classification, spam detection, sentiment analysis  

4. **Lexicon-Based Methods**  
   - Definition: Uses dictionaries or sentiment lexicons to analyze text.  
   - Applications: Sentiment analysis, opinion mining  

5. **POS Tagging & Parsing**  
   - POS Tagging: Label words with grammatical tags (noun, verb, etc.)  
   - Parsing: Analyze sentence structure using grammar rules  
   - Applications: Machine translation, question answering, syntactic analysis

## 🤖 Advanced AI NLP Methods

**Advanced NLP** uses deep learning, attention mechanisms, and transformer architectures to model text with context and meaning.  

### Key Methods
1. **Word Embeddings**  
   - Definition: Converts words into dense vectors capturing semantic meaning.  
   - Examples: Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText  
   - Applications: Semantic similarity, clustering, recommendation systems  

2. **RNN / LSTM / GRU**  
   - Definition: Sequence models for text that retain context.  
   - Applications: Text generation, machine translation, sentiment analysis  

3. **CNN for NLP**  
   - Definition: Detects local patterns in text using convolution operations.  
   - Applications: Text classification, sentiment analysis  

4. **Seq2Seq & Attention**  
   - Definition: Encoder-decoder models with attention focus on relevant words.  
   - Applications: Translation, summarization, question answering  

5. **Transformers**  
   - Definition: Fully attention-based models that handle long-range dependencies efficiently.  
   - Examples: BERT, RoBERTa, GPT  
   - Applications: Sentiment analysis, NER, chatbots, summarization  


6. **Large Language Models (LLMs)**  
   - Definition: Massive transformer models trained on huge datasets, capable of multi-task NLP.  
   - Examples: GPT-4, ChatGPT, LLaMA  
   - Applications: Conversational AI, code generation, text summarization
